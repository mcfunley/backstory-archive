This scrapes Backstory Radio's archive and generates a valid-enough podcast feed of all of the old episodes. 

They don't publish all of their episodes on their feed, which makes them inconvenient to get in a podcast app such as Downcast.

The resulting xml file can be hosted statically wherever, and imported manually.
